## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
###### ![deliverable 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114840416/220795916-82ecf51f-1b9a-4875-9327-f833e52d350a.PNG)
###### The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values is **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearance.** 
###### The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because the p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11).
###### The linear model will predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes correctly roughly 71% of the time because the R-Squared is .7149.

###### As the provided image above shows, the total manufacturing lots in total meet the design with a Variance of ~62 PSI. However, when the lots are broken down indivually it appears only Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the PSI requirements but lot 3 has a much higher variance and standard deviation. So indivudally speaking Lot 3 does not meet the requirements.
