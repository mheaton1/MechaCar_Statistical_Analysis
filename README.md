## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
###### ![deliverable 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114840416/220795916-82ecf51f-1b9a-4875-9327-f833e52d350a.PNG)
###### The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values is **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearance.** 
###### The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because the p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11).
###### The linear model will predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes correctly roughly 71% of the time because the R-Squared is .7149.
